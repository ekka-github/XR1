This XR project contains two projects, Arrowstorm (VR) and Furnize (AR)

Our VR game is a FPS game with a Bow, where the player has to hit targets at a long distance to increase their score.

Our second application Furnize is a AR application, where you can test to see if certain furniture fits inside of your apartment / house.
